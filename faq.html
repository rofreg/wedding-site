      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Is the wedding on?</h2>
        <p>Yes! We are on for our original wedding date of June 12<sup>th</sup>, with the requirement that all guests must be vaccinated.</p>

        <h2>When are RSVPs due?</h2>
        <p>RSVPs were due on May 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>

        <h2>What if I can’t get vaccinated before the wedding?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, we will ask you not to attend. We’re really, incredibly sad about this!!! But we’ve spent a long time looking at the tradeoffs, and we think that delaying the date would come with real human costs as well. We hope to celebrate with you in many other ways in the months and years to come.</p>

        <h2>What is the deadline for getting vaccinated?</h2>
        <p>Your first shot must occur by May 29<sup>th</sup> (2 weeks before the wedding), regardless of which vaccine you receive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For the 1-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, this is the CDC’s recommended waiting period to consider yourself “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">fully vaccinated</a>”.</li>
          <li>For the 2-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm">latest CDC studies</a> show that even a single shot reaches 80% effectiveness after 2 weeks (vs. 90% for 2 weeks after the second shot). Given this data, we think it’s responsible to admit guests who have only received one mRNA shot, as long as that shot occurred at least 2 weeks before the wedding. (Make sure to get your second shot as soon as you can, though – second doses are still super important!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What about kids?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, since no vaccines have been approved for children at this time, we are currently asking children not to attend. Again, we’re very sorry about this – we realize how much of a burden it places on our friends and family with kids.</p>

        <h2>What restrictions will there be at the wedding?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/whatsupnewp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Restrictions-Slide_5.20.jpg?w=1280&ssl=1">Rhode Island lifted most COVID restrictions for vaccinated people on May 21<sup>st</sup></a>. We will not be requiring masks or social distancing at the wedding venue, given that all guests will be vaccinated, but we encourage everyone to take precautions as you see fit, particularly those who are traveling. (Masks are still very much welcome, we're just not requiring them!)</p>

        <h2>What should I know about the venue?</h2>
        <p>The Roger Williams Botanical Center is a large, high-ceilinged, well-ventilated greenhouse. We intend to have an outdoor ceremony followed by an indoor reception, with windows and doors left open to maximize airflow. Studies and expert advice indicate that good ventilation is highly important to reduce the risk of COVID transmission, and we are following that advice as much as possible.</p>

        <h2>What else should I know to help me make my decision?</h2>
        <p>We’ve made as many changes as we can to guarantee safety, including reducing the guest count, maximizing the use of outdoor space, working with our vendors to adjust plans, and more. If you have specific questions or concerns, please reach out and let us know!</p>
