      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Will vaccines really be available in time?</h2>
        <p>It’s going to be close, but it looks like it! We’ve been following a variety of different sources on this over the past 6 months:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The Biden administration expects to make COVID vaccines available to all adults <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/11/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-announce-all-americans-to-be-eligible-for-vaccinations-by-may-1-puts-the-nation-on-a-path-to-get-closer-to-normal-by-july-4th/">by May 1</a>. In New England, all states have announced general availability by April 19.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html#projection">The New York Times</a> projects that even with no increase over the current vaccination pace, the vast majority of eligible US adults should be vaccinated by mid-June. (We’ve double-checked that number with state-level projections for Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and indeed, those states are matching that pace.)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/#us">Bloomberg</a> shows the rate of daily vaccinations steadily increasing over the last 3 months, lending more credence to the NY Times timeline mentioned above.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/02/cdc-fully-vaccinated-may-travel/">The latest CDC guidance</a> considers travel to be low-risk for fully vaccinated people.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What if I can’t get vaccinated before the wedding?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, we will ask you not to attend. We’re really, incredibly sad about this!!! But we’ve spent a long time looking at the tradeoffs, and we think that delaying the date would come with real human costs as well. We hope to celebrate with you in many other ways in the months and years to come.</p>

        <h2>What is the deadline for getting vaccinated?</h2>
        <p>Your first shot must occur by May 29<sup>th</sup> (2 weeks before the wedding), regardless of which vaccine you receive.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>For the 1-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, this is the CDC’s recommended waiting period to consider yourself “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">fully vaccinated</a>”.</li>
          <li>For the 2-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm">latest CDC studies</a> show that even a single shot reaches 80% effectiveness after 2 weeks (vs. 90% for 2 weeks after the second shot). Given this data, we think it’s responsible to admit guests who have only received one mRNA shot, as long as that shot occurred at least 2 weeks before the wedding. (Make sure to get your second shot as soon as you can, though – second doses are still super important!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What about kids?</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, since no vaccines have been approved for children at this time, we are currently asking children not to attend. Again, we’re very sorry about this – we realize how much of a burden it places on our friends and family with kids.</p>

        <h2>What other restrictions will there be at the wedding?</h2>
        <p>As of March 26, the latest Rhode Island guidelines for weddings can be found <a href="https://reopeningri.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Protect-Your-Household-Guidance.pdf">here</a>. Current restrictions include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A COVID event specialist must be present for the duration of the event</li>
          <li>All guests must show proof of a negative COVID test from the previous 48 hours</li>
          <li>Staff must be masked and gloved</li>
          <li>Various additional restrictions apply to cocktail hour, bar service, dancing, etc, including masking and social distancing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We believe that some of these restrictions may be eased if vaccinations continue smoothly and COVID case counts continue to decline. (Notably, if all guests are vaccinated and the state restrictions allow it, we do not intend to require guests to be masked.) Regardless, we will be following state rules AND evaluating our own additional restrictions if the official state guidelines seem too lax.</p>

        <h2>What should I know about the venue?</h2>
        <p>The Roger Williams Botanical Center is a large, high-ceilinged, well-ventilated greenhouse. We intend to have an outdoor ceremony followed by an indoor reception, with windows and doors left open to maximize airflow. Studies and expert advice indicate that good ventilation is highly important to reduce the risk of COVID transmission, and we are following that advice as much as possible.</p>

        <h2>What else should I know to help me make my decision?</h2>
        <p>We’re making as many changes as we can to guarantee safety, including reducing the guest count, maximizing the use of outdoor space, working with our vendors to adjust plans, and more. If you have specific questions or concerns, please reach out and let us know. The decision of whether to attend is ultimately up to you – and again, we will absolutely understand if you decide not to come.</p>
