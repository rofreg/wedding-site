        Hey folks! It's almost wedding time! 🎉<br>
        Here are a few final updates and reminders about the  festivities ahead.
      </p>
      <h2>💍 Ceremony</h2>
      <p>
        The ceremony is on Saturday at 5:45pm, at the Roger Williams Park Botanical Center. Weather permitting, the ceremony will be out on the lawn of the Botanical Center, to be followed by a cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing inside the Center itself.
      </p>

      <h2>👔 Dress code</h2>
      <p>In short: cocktail attire, or dressy casual. Wear something nice, and feel free to get a bit festive! If there's some fashionable outfit that's been gathering dust in your closet, you're welcome to show it off. We're here to celebrate after a very long year, and creativity and color are welcome 🌈</p>
      <p>Also, a reminder: the ceremony itself will take place on the lawn, so if you'd like to wear heels, plan accordingly!</p>

      <h2>🚌 Transportation</h2>

      <p>Shuttles will leave from outside the Graduate hotel at 4:45pm and 5:15pm, and will return to the Graduate hotel several times later in the evening, once dancing begins. The last shuttle will leave after the last dance, around 11pm.</p>

      <p>You are also welcome to drive to the venue – the Botanical Center is only a 15 minute drive from downtown Providence, and there is a parking lot right next to it with plenty of spots. Just enter "Roger Williams Park Botanical Center" into Google Maps or Apple Maps, and you should be directed to the correct location inside Roger Williams Park. If you'd prefer printed directions and/or a map of Roger Williams Park, you can find that information here: <a href="http://www.necps.org/documents/misc/Direction_BC_map.pdf">http://www.necps.org/documents/misc/Direction_BC_map.pdf</a></p>

      <h2>😷 COVID restrictions</h2>

      <p>Rhode Island has effectively dropped all COVID restrictions for people who are vaccinated. Given that all of our guests have been vaccinated, we will not be requiring masks or social distancing, though we welcome everyone to take precautions as you see fit. We will have spare masks and hand sanitizer on hand for anyone who wants them. (Remember: if you want to give someone a hug, it's polite to ask for their permission first, in case they are still practicing social distancing!)</p>

      <h2>🍽 Dinner</h2>

      <p>In our RSVPs, we asked everyone for dinner preferences, but we will actually be serving dinner family-style rather than individually plated – so you're welcome to try a bit of everything! (Family-style service was our original catering plan, but we weren't sure if COVID restrictions would allow that. Turns out it wasn't a problem!) For those of you with dietary restrictions, don't worry: we've passed along all of that info to our caterer, and food is being prepared accordingly so that everyone can eat safely and according to their wishes.</p>

      <h2>🥯 Post-wedding brunch</h2>

      <p>Speaking of food: on Sunday morning, you're welcome to join us for a casual post-wedding brunch at the Splitwise office. The office is just a few minutes' walk from The Graduate, at 150 Union St, Suite 606. We'll have coffee and bagels and pastries and other odds and ends. The door to the building is often locked, so if you are stuck outside, call 401-354-1821 and someone can let you in. For the comfort of other residents, please bring a mask to wear in any common areas (e.g. in the building entryway and in the elevators).</p>

      <h2>🎉 And that should be it!</h2>

      <p>We are BEYOND excited to see you all in just a few short days – it seems absolutely wild, after a long year of separation and worry and doubt. We are really, truly grateful for the opportunity to celebrate with each and every one of you. LET'S DO THIS THING 💃🕺</p>

      <p>All of our love,<br>
      -Ryan and Allison</p>
